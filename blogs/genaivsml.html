    <div class="container">
        <p>Generative AI and Machine Learning are often discussed together, but they serve different purposes. While both are under the broad umbrella of artificial intelligence, they have unique roles and applications. Let’s explore the key differences between them.</p>

        <h2>What is Generative AI?</h2>
        <p>Generative AI refers to AI systems capable of creating new content based on patterns learned from data. These models can generate text, images, music, and more. Common techniques in Generative AI include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformers like GPT.</p>
        <p>For example, a generative AI can write articles, create artwork, or even compose new music that mimics human creativity. It synthesizes new data that didn’t previously exist.</p>

        <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
        <p>Machine Learning, on the other hand, is the broader concept of AI that focuses on teaching computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. It can encompass a variety of tasks, such as classification, regression, and clustering, using models like decision trees and neural networks.</p>
        <p>In essence, machine learning focuses on pattern recognition and data-driven decision-making.</p>

        <h2>Key Differences:</h2>
        <p><strong>Generative AI</strong> focuses on creating new data or content, while <strong>Machine Learning</strong> primarily focuses on recognizing patterns and making predictions based on existing data.</p>
        <p>Generative AI models are more creative, while Machine Learning models are typically predictive or analytical in nature.</p>
